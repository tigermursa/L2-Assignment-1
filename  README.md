**Blog - 1 What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?**

In TypeScript, both interfaces and types help you define custom data shapes, but they work differently. First, interfaces let you combine properties easily. If you declare the same interface name multiple times, TypeScript automatically merges all the properties into one. For example, if you write an interface for a "User" with a "name" and later add another "User" interface with an "age", TypeScript treats it as a single interface with both fields. Types, however, cannot be reused like this—once you define a type, you can’t add new properties later.

Another difference is how they extend. Interfaces use the extends keyword to inherit properties from other interfaces, like building on a base shape. Types, on the other hand, use & to mix multiple types into one. Types are also more flexible—they can define unions (like a value being a string or number), tuples (fixed-size arrays), or even rename simple types. Interfaces are simpler and focus only on object shapes. Use interfaces for objects (like API data or React props) and types for advanced logic, like combining or mixing values.

**Blog - 2 How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?**
TypeScript acts like a smart assistant for JavaScript, helping you write cleaner and safer code. First, it catches mistakes early. For example, if your function expects numbers but gets a string, TypeScript warns you instantly—no more waiting until the code runs to find bugs! It also makes your code easier to understand. By defining types for variables or objects, you create clear rules (like a "Student" must have a name and age), which helps teams work together without confusion.

TypeScript also improves tools like VS Code. Your editor will suggest autocomplete options, show errors, and explain what each part of your code does, saving you time. Another big advantage is fearless refactoring. If you rename a variable or change a type, TypeScript points out every place in your code that needs updating, so you don’t miss anything. You don’t have to rewrite old projects either—TypeScript works with plain JavaScript, so you can add it slowly. Plus, it supports modern JavaScript features but converts them to older versions so they work in all browsers. Overall, TypeScript keeps big projects organized, reduces errors, and makes coding less stressful
